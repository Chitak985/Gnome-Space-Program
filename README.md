# Gnome Space Program

Some things to note:
A couple textures in the game are from freepbr.com and don't allow commercial use. ``Look at Gnome-Space-Program/Assets/Textures/000_TEXTURE_CREDIT.txt``
I intend to remove these textures and replace them with my own before releasing this game commercially!

## NOTES FOR CONTRIBUTORS:

### 1. Major disclaimer:
This game is open source. By contributing your code/assets you agree to it being placed under the game's pemissive GPL-3.0 license.
As I intend to sell the game on Steam (and other platforms) AND due to the nature of this project, I simply cannot compensate all of the contributors monetarily.
If you wish, you may credit yourself in the Contributors.json file in GameData. Contributors can also recieve a Steam key (when/if this game releases on Steam)

### 2. Conventions and rules for contributing:
* When starting a pull request, you MUST state what you changed down to each file and line.
* This is more or less just a general "keep your code clean" rule, but please ensure that any major changes you make don't break any other existing system.
* Avoid modifying work-in-progress systems. This can easily cause a conflict of interest.

### 3. Help me review pull requests!
I (Sushut) am fairly busy a lot of the time. I greatly appreciate it if the community could check pull requests for anything ranging from potential malicious code to simple conflicts. Strength in numbers and all.
